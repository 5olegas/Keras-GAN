# Keras-GAN
## Introduction
- (Families of) Generative Adversarial Network with Keras (Theano backend)
    - [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

## NOTE
- Update to Keras-2.0 after 19 May 2017.
- Codes for keras-1.0 (deprecated) is stored in `legacy/`. It has a lot of bugs and I DO NOT recommend you to refer them totally.
- Check `scripts/mnist.py` for usage.
